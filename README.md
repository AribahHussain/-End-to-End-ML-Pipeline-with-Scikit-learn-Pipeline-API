# -End-to-End-ML-Pipeline-with-Scikit-learn-Pipeline-API
Build an end-to-end Scikit-learn pipeline for customer churn prediction with preprocessing, model tuning, and export using joblib.
# ğŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction with Scikit-learn Pipeline

This project demonstrates a reusable and production-ready ML pipeline to predict customer churn using the Telco dataset.

## ğŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Scikit-learn (Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, GridSearchCV)
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Joblib for model export

## âœ… Workflow
1. Load and preprocess data (scaling, encoding)
2. Build a full pipeline with preprocessing + model
3. Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
4. Evaluate and export pipeline with joblib

## ğŸ“¦ Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

> This approach ensures modularity, maintainability, and deployment-readiness.
