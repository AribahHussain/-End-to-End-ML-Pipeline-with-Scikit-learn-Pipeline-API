 📑 Project Report
📝 Project Report: End-to-End ML Pipeline for Customer Churn Prediction
🎯 Objective
To build a modular and reusable ML pipeline for predicting customer churn using the Telco Churn Dataset, following best practices for real-world deployment.

📁 Dataset: Telco Churn
Contains customer demographics, service subscriptions, and churn label

Goal: Predict whether a customer is likely to churn

⚙️ Tools and Libraries
Scikit-learn: Model training, pipelines, tuning

Pandas: Data analysis

Joblib: Model serialization

🛠️ Key Components
1. Data Preprocessing (with Pipeline)
Handled using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline

Steps included:

Label Encoding / OneHotEncoding for categorical features

StandardScaler for numerical features

Missing value imputation (if needed)

2. Model Training
Models included:

Logistic Regression for baseline

Random Forest for ensemble learning

Used Pipeline to combine preprocessing and model into a single object

3. Hyperparameter Tuning
Employed GridSearchCV for:

Logistic Regression (C, regularization)

Random Forest (n_estimators, max_depth)

Cross-validated model selection ensured better generalization

4. Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion matrix

5. Model Export
Exported the entire pipeline (preprocessing + model) using joblib
📈 Skills Gained
🔁 Reusable Pipeline Design

🔍 Feature Engineering & Encoding

📊 Model Evaluation & Cross-Validation

🛠️ Hyperparameter Optimization with GridSearch

📦 Model Deployment Readiness (via joblib)

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end machine learning workflow using Scikit-learn that is clean, reproducible, and ready for deployment. It ensures:

Cleaner code structure

Less error-prone feature processing

Easier model reuse in real-world scenarios
